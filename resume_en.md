## Experience
### Honovation (2013.09-Presentï¼Œ5+years)

  Business Keywords: Reporting, Member, Product, Trade, Promotion, Coupon, Finance, eInvoice, ERP(SAP), Warehouse, Logistics, Notification, After service, Refund, JD, Tmall, WeChat, OA, O2O

* Restful APIs

* PostgreSQL: SQL skills, backup and recovery (Barman)

* Linux Container: isolate subsystems on metal host

* Fix performance issues

  A majority of process time of asynchronous task is load time, after executed, the process exits. I changed async queue logic, after executed the process do not exit, it just keeps alive unless the count of execution exceeds a threshold as preventing memory leak.

* Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana

  Use Logstash collects application logs, stores to Elasticsearch and then query on Kibana, also analyze recently request status code or process time.

* automate deploy: Install dependencies, packages, enforce security levels from bare metal to runnable application

* automate test: python unittest and selenium+chrome for web test

* integrate with SAP

* use OCR service to parse images and find prohibited words

* multip channels tracking: track multip channels like GA, generate every channel report

* Others but very important

  Business domain naming, unify coding style, refactor frequently, add tests, make dependency between modules sence, decouple, etc.
