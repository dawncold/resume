* Fix performance issues

  A majority of process time of asynchronous task is load time, after executed, the process exits. I changed async queue logic, after executed the process do not exit, it just keeps alive unless the count of execution exceeds a threshold as preventing memory leak.

* Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana

  Use Logstash collects application logs, stores to Elasticsearch and then query on Kibana, also analyze recently request status code or process time.

  Business domain naming, unify coding style, refactor frequently, add tests, make dependency between modules sence, decouple, etc.
